Hey there 👋

I’m Sujal, a full stack developer focused on building clean, scalable web applications.

I mostly work with the MERN stack, with a strong interest in backend logic, APIs, and database-driven systems.

This profile is where I share projects, experiments, and things I’m actively building — everything written and structured by me.
